            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAVING received information from you of the paſſages in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I have thought it neceſſary to give you by this bearer (a friend of mine) notice of our occurrences and proceedings of late in this Kingdome.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:112251:3"/>
            <p>On the 22. of September the great Rebel Oneal came before Munſter with neer 15000. men, threatning ruine and deſtruction to all that ſhould any way reſiſt them, pretending withall, that he had the Kings authority for what he did: but I conceive that is but a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ſhew and falſe pretence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he beguiled the ignorant Iriſh, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king example, as I conceive, of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants of your Kingdome, who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour all their vvicked and malicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes under a pretence of ſtanding for His Majeſty, and the defence of the true Proteſtant Religion, when indeed their ends are like his, tending to nothing but ruine and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But we, being well acquainted with his trecherous actions, and knowing that our chief ſecurity conſiſted in Gods protection and our own timely preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gathered our ſelves together under the command of our Vice-Preſident: and though we were but a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in compariſon of his forces, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112251:3"/>put into a martial equipage, we fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted boldly, without demanding the cauſe of his preſent arrivall.</p>
            <p>This ſudden and unexpected charge proved very advantagious to us, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious to them: for inſtead of making good their ground, they loſt their order, which by the continuall motion and ſtriving of the groſſe body, was rather more diſordered, then any way recovered, by which meanes our men did very great execution upon the army of the Rebels, routing and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their maine Batalia, our Troupes of Horſe falling upon their flanks, and trampling the Iriſh Kernes like morter upon the ground: it was a kinde of delight to us to heare the muſicke that was made betwixt the Drums &amp; Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, our ſhouts, and their acclamations, which were much ſhriller then the Trumpets, and indeed were heard lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then any part of the conſort. To be ſhort, we ſlew above two hundred of the Rebels forces, and wee loſt not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112251:4"/>above twenty five: only ſome that were wounded in the purſuit with their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons which were ſcattered upon the ground, eſpecially pikes, and ſome skenes, which we reſerved; onely the pikes, by reaſon that wee wanted wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, wee were commanded to burne them, to the end that they might bee made unfit to be imployd in any ſervice againſt us. Philomy Oneale was in ſuch haſte to eſcape, that he took up his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that night in the woods, &amp; the next day ſtole away diſguiſed in the habit of a common ſouldier. Our Province is cleered neer thirty miles round about.</p>
            <p>I received information from the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of Gallway, that the Engliſh ſhips imployed by the Parliament of England have lately had in chaſe certain Spaniſh Frigots, laden with ammunition, which were intended to be landed for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Rebels, but being prevented and cloſely chaſed by the Engliſh ſhips, they ſtrucke into a Creeke ſome three miles from Galway, which goes from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112251:4"/>the Ocean up to Munſter, but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the turnings of the channell, and running with a ſtiffe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right wind, they ſtruck upon a ſhelve, and ſtuck faſt, ſo that before they could get their Ordnance aſhore to guard their fraught, they were cloſe ſet upon by the Engliſh, which were put on ſhore from the ſhips in long boats, and they with their rich fraught were ſeized on to bee imployed againſt the Rebels.</p>
            <p>The Scottiſh Forces under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Colonell Leſley have behaved themſelves very nobly, and oftentimes put the rebels to the worſt, having taken many Caſtles, and other places of great eminency.</p>
            <p>Our Commanders play falſe play, and leave us: My Lord Grandiſon hath left his Troupe to the wide world, Captain Bartlet hath forſaken us, and Captaine Gibſon, with many others. Other our Officers that are reſident with us, play leaſt in ſight: they have got into ſtrong holds, and doe nothing, but ſuffer the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112251:5"/>Rebels to come up to the very walls of Dublin, doing ſpoile, robbing and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the inhabitants without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: Likewiſe they pretend, that they are commanded to deſiſt, but by what authority, they denie to make knowne: but wee have great cauſe to feare that they are popiſhly affected, and by their practiſes do further the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in England. If we had but ſome preſent ſupply, we doubt not but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our priſtine liberty; but if things continue at this ſtay, we are all deſtined to ruine, and the Kingdome muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie be utterly loſt. I pray remember our diſtreſſed eſtate in your prayers, and according to your opportunity let me heare what paſſes in England. So in haſt I reſt,</p>
